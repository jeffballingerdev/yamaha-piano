                    In 1900, a small company started by Torakusu Yamaha built Japan’s first upright piano. Just two
                    years later, they would create the country’s first grand piano, which would go on to receive an
                    Honorary Grand Prize at the St. Louis World’s Fair. Torakusu and his craftsmen would soon be
                    traveling the world with their instruments, earning praise from the era’s most acclaimed pianists.
                    <br /><br />
                    In 1928, famed pianist Leo Sirota wrote, “I have played the Yamaha piano many times and have come to
                    the conclusion that this instrument is equal to the best pianos from Germany and America.” Feedback
                    from pianists like Sirota and Artur Rubinstein, along with leading edge techniques learned from
                    European piano makers would help take the pianos made by Torakusu Yamaha to new heights.

                    In 1950, after years of research and development, Yamaha released the FC concert grand. Performances
                    by pianists such as Adolf Baller, Walter Gieseking and “Lion of the Keyboard” Wilhelm Backhaus
                    helped earn the FC a reputation as a world-class piano.
                    <br /><br />
                    By 1965, Yamaha was producing more pianos than any company in the world. The first pianos designed,
                    patented and manufactured entirely by Yamaha – C Series grands and U Series uprights – began rolling
                    out of the new state-of-the-art factory in Kakegawa, Japan. The C Series would earn fame as the most
                    recorded piano in history, played by some of the most popular artists of the last 50 years including
                    Elton John, Alicia Keys, Paul McCartney, John Legend, Sarah McLachlan, Jamie Cullum, Sheryl Crow,
                    Chick Corea and Sara Bareilles. The U Series would go on to become the world’s most popular upright
                    piano.
                    <br /><br />
                    But Yamaha craftsmen were already on to the next challenge. Cesare Tallone, Europe’s most respected
                    piano technician, was working with Yamaha on a new concert grand. In November 1967, Yamaha unveiled
                    the CF concert grand piano during a banquet at Tokyo’s Hotel Okura. Famed pianist Wilhelm Kempff
                    played the CF that night and called it, “One of the top pianos in the world.”

                  One by one, European music festivals adopted the CF as their official piano. The Freiberg Music
                  Festival in Germany, the Toul Music Festival, La Roque d’Antheron and the historic La Chaise-Dieu
                  Festival in France. So many Menton Music Festival pianists had insisted on playing the Yamaha CF
                  that it was chosen as the festival’s sole official piano.
                  <br /><br />
                  The success of the CF inspired Yamaha craftsmen to develop a new concert grand piano with the power
                  and tonal quality to fill even the largest hall with rich, resonant sound. In 1983, Yamaha unveiled
                  the CFIII Yamaha concert grand piano, which was an instant success.
                  <br /><br />
                  Famed Russian pianist Sviatoslav Richter used the new piano for every performance of his tour in
                  Italy. It was designated as the sole official piano of the International Johann Sebastian Bach
                  Competition in Germany, the official instrument of Poland’s International Chopin Piano Competition
                  and official piano for the prestigious International Tchaikovsky Competition in Russia.

                  In the late 1970s and 80s, the digital era would spark a series of Yamaha innovations that helped
                  redefine the modern piano.
                  <br /><br />
                  In 1983, Yamaha introduced the world to a new kind of piano - the Clavinova. The revolutionary YP-40
                  put the power and performance of a grand piano in a portable, electric keyboard for the first time,
                  bringing big sound to smaller spaces.
                  <br /><br />
                  In 1987, Yamaha Disklavier took the idea of a player piano to the next level. Disklavier was
                  originally conceived to faithfully reproduce performances so music professors could critique their
                  students. But it didn’t take long for artists to realize this technology offered nearly endless
                  possibilities. In 2013, Elton John streamed his live performance to Disklavier pianos in ten
                  countries. Each one played his actual keystrokes, note for note, in real time, as if he were there.
                  <br /><br />
                  In 1993, Yamaha introduced the SILENT Piano™, removing all limits to where and when artists could
                  play. And bringing the exceptional tone of the world’s finest instruments straight to your
                  headphones.

                  In May 2010, after 19 years of prototypes and input from the world’s most acclaimed pianists, Yamaha
                  unveiled the CF Series concert grand piano. As the company’s flagship, it is considered the pinnacle
                  of
                  pianos. In October 2010, Russian pianist Yulianna Avdeeva, performing on a Yamaha CFX, won first
                  prize
                  at the 16th International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw, Poland - the first time a pianist won
                  playing a Japanese-made piano.
                  <br /><br />
                  In 2016, the once tiny company started by Torakusu Yamaha also received the prestigious “Top 100
                  Global
                  Innovator” award from Thomson Reuters for the third consecutive year. TIME included the Yamaha
                  Clavinova
                  on a list of the most influential technologies of the last fifty years alongside groundbreaking
                  inventions such as the color television, Gameboy and iPhone.
